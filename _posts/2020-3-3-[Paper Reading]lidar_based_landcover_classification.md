### Supervised Parametric Classification of Aerial LiDAR Data
#### Abstract
+ Since the terrain is highly undulating, we subtract the terrain elevations using digital elevation models (DEMs, easily 
available from the United States Geological Survey (USGS)) to obtain the height of objects from a flat level. 
+ use height texture (variation in height), intensity (amplitude of lidar response), multiple (two) returns from lidar 
 and luminance (measured in the visible spectrum) from aerial imagery to classify the data into four disjoint classes 
 - trees, grass, roads and building roofs.
+ used mixture of Gaussian models for modeling the training data. Model parameters and the posterior probabilities are 
estimated using Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.

+ "Surface clustering from airborne laser scanning data" propose a surface clustering technique for identifying regions in LiDAR data that exhibit 
homogeneity in a certain feature space consisting of position, tangent plane and relative height difference attributes for every point. The surfaces 
are categorized as high vegetation (that exhibit rapid variations in slopes and height jumps), low vegetation, smooth surfaces and planar surfaces.

#### Proposed Method
##### classification problem
C classes, d-dim feature x.  The posterior probability of a data sample x belonging to a particular class i can be computed using Bayes rule as:

                                                            P(i|x) = p(x|i) * P(i) / p(x)
                                                            p(x) = sum<p(x|i)P(i)>, P(i) is the prior probability of class
it is usualy safe to set P(i) equal to 1/C for all class i, so next is determine the class-density probablity p(x|i). That's what Mixture Model do!
